  * This gain is multiplied by the i gain. When controller
  * saturates, the desired control value will be saturated value
  * + (1/gain)*goal_difference_error; So higher the gain,the
  * control value will be closer to the saturation and will
  * respond to quicker as soon as control moves away from
  * saturation.
  *
  * A smaller gain will not pull the integrator towards the saturating
  * value quickly. If the current value of integrator is small and
  * we use a large saturation gain, the integrator value will quickly
  * converge to the saturation value which implies it will take
  * longer to get back to normal integral values based on integration
  * gains. So for smaller integration gains, you should also use a
  * smaller saturation gain to ensure we do not quickly saturate
  * the integrator when we are at the limits.
